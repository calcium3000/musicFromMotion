# musicFromMotion
Convert your slick grooves into sweet tunes.  Body movements are transmitted wirelessly to a host computer and then translated into pre-programmed beats and instruments.  And everything is reconfigurable on the fly; you can serenade or offend the airwaves however you please.

See https://calcium3000.wordpress.com/projects/mfm/ for more information on the project.
